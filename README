Hi, this is me trying to move my browser setup from kde
to i3.

What you'll find here:

 - urls is a text file with urls, one per line,
   divided into sections with a blank line

   The format of urls, is that each section has several
   urls, and the end of a section is marked by a blank
   line.

   example,

   url
   url
   url

   url
   url
   url
   url

   url
   url

 - browse-urls.py is a python script that reads urls and
   outputs firefox commands to load each url into either
   a browser window or a browser tab.

 - README is the file you're now looking at.
